# Nepcord
Nepcord is a Discord bot platform and API for easy interaction with Discord's WebSocket/REST API.  

# Stuff that needs to be done  
* Resume support  
* Move away from RestSharp and WebSocketSharp - find an alternative for .NET Core (and Windows 7 >:C)  
* Rewrite  

# Development
* Create a file called `secret.json` - and put a `token` variable inside with your Bot User Token  
* Build.
